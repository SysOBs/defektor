## 2NDO SEMESTRE


25/02: look for mongodb, reddis (in storage)

Problems:
    - The performance looks horrible with MapDB (Well, maybe not)

 04/03: start doing UML diagrams

 11/03:
  - Start developing system type plugins

18/03:
  - Could not be present in the meeting

25/03:
  Questions:
    - Configure SystemType: This could be achieved by either turning the API stateful (which is not exactly the purpose of a REST API)
      OR saving this information in the client-side (dfk) and using it everytime a request needs it.
      In this last case, this information should be wrapped inside the Plan object. -> Submit de um systemconfig/systemtype
    - What is the exact purpose of a SystemType object? Should it act as intermediary for ijk plugin instructions. So, if the pod delete ijk need to perform instructions on a
    k8, should the system plugin be an intermediary? -> Criar nova entity SystemConfig que faz parte do SystemType ; - look for client config
    SystemType recebe um SystemConfig

    - What should be stored in the SystemType object? It was discussed that it would be mandatory the name of the system and an array of commands. For instance with Kubernetes,
    as long as there is .kube/config file there should be no additional configs for the kubernetes plugin.
    - In the SystemTarget object it is described the multiple target type (i.e. node, pod,...). Should it be described which Ijks are capable of target every single TargetType?

    Suggestions:
        - Compare gant's diagram with the current work.
